nlox is a Nim implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter. This implementation is based on the jlox interpreter, which is done in Java.

## What is Lox?
Lox is a scripting language created by Robert Nystrom to teach in a practical way the implementation of a programming language throughout the book Crafting Interpreters. To learn more, visit [craftinginterpreters.com](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Why write another Lox interpreter?
I have always been interested in learning how a programming language is implemented and the book Crafting Interpreters brings this in a very didactic and practical way. So it's a perfect opportunity to learn something new and develop myself as a programmer.

## Why use the Nim programming language?
Nim is currently the programming language I have the best aptitude for and I feel more comfortable exploring something new and unknown. I will try to keep this Nim implementation as faithful as possible with the base implementation made in Java. There will certainly be crazy refactorings of code throughout the book.
